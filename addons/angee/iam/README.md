# IAM access and credential actions

The Share dialog is IAM's one-record People surface. `record_readers` lists
named effective person readers through REBAC's subject lookup after the
model's declared share permissions are checked. Wildcard and authenticated
audiences have no finite person roster.
The lookup returns identities, not the relation paths that granted them. Exact
direct grants come from `record_access`, including groups, subject types and
each grantable relation; a reader may have more than one. A model owner
declares a component as a `<model>#access-roles` child (IAM's model-scoped
`iam#access-roles` container). It registers its live
role roster and admission/removal verbs with `useAccessRole`; IAM merges those
rows only with the effective readers returned by that lookup. A role
admission that requests a follow grants read and follows in one server
transaction. `ShareAccessRailGroup`, as a `<model>#rail` child, presents the
same Share adapter in the record rail. Direct relation labels come from scoped
resource vocabulary's `relations` map; an undeclared label displays the
lowercase relation id. A visibility policy offers only its owner-declared
values and states their consequence alongside the control. A model owner
registers one through a `<model>#access-visibility` child and
`useAccessVisibility`; proposals uses it for the round's opening policy and its
confirmed opening verb.

Saved User records inherit IAM's issue-password action. `useIssuePasswordAction`
is exported for other IAM-owned presentations. Eligibility comes from
`can_issue_password`; the mutation is transient and the returned secret lives
only in a read-only, copyable `usePrompt` reveal. No credential is added to a
record or query cache. The existing manually entered reset action and its policy
remain unchanged.
