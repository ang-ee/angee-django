# Directory synchronization

A Directory composes the [record-sync driver](../integrate/README.md). Each
address book maps to a Folder and contacts stream; RecordLink owns external
identity and wire payloads. Party rows remain independent of any one directory.

The [CardDAV backend](../parties_integrate_carddav/backend.py) compares the shared
[contact projection](backends.py); wire properties outside that projection stay
in RecordLink history and survive conditional writes.

[PartyManager.ingest_contact](managers.py) asserts directory facts; Address and
Relationship keep their own identities and statements. Missing members withdraw
only that source. Canonical scopes retain unasserted rows and exclude trash and
wholly withdrawn rows. [Handle sources](managers.py) compose `Party.statements`
through the shared Handle, Party lock order; resolution owns the cross-party
winner and derived counters outside Party history.

A card's `PHOTO` is stored as the person's avatar through storage's idempotent
`File.objects.ingest_image` before the page transaction; a photo storage refuses
(not a raster image, or over `ANGEE_STORAGE_IMAGE_MAX_BYTES`) quarantines its
card while the rest of the page lands, and write-back refuses to send such an
avatar as a remote rejection. Only the person's own `avatar` is projected. A
handle carries the avatar its own network shows: live sessions report it as an
`AvatarReport` through `Handle.objects.fill_avatar`, which never creates a
handle. A party without a readable avatar of its own displays the avatar of its
strongest handle the viewer can read (`Party.objects.display_avatar`); that
fallback is derived for reading and never stored or written to a card. Avatars
live on storage's image drive, which every signed-in user reads; which avatar a
party or handle shows stays with that record's readers.

A handle that proves to be another's spelling (a resolved messenger alias) moves
its handle statements onto the surviving handle through
`Party.objects.move_handle_statements`, the generic reference move a record
merge performs: collisions stay inspectable as superseded, so every decision and
its evidence survive.

Ordinary person edits assert normal statements; confirm/dismiss writes preferred
statements without rewriting the source or copying evidence. Person preferences
survive remote removal: confirmed handles can be republished; dismissal makes
removal stick. Revert restores local state; sync retains its remote preconditions.
Consumers declare domain aspects; losing statements stay inspectable, and normal
handle statements below the Party's review threshold remain pending review.

Review and Identity read through the Party, with independent Handle and evidence
gates. Once asserted, subjects leave active use only through trash;
retained statements protect their subjects and Handle evidence from deletion.
Circle and spaces memberships keep plain acceptance/rejection decisions.

Source admission follows RecordLinks and seeded Rule/Seed role membership.
Sources and migrated carrier readers gain no private reads. Imports supply their
Integration and observed links; parties binds targets in the application transaction.

Identity matching writes normal RULE same_as statements on the ordered Party
pair, skipping current assertions and dismissals before each run's cap without
continuation state. A preferred no_value is the symmetric anti-link; preferred value
awaits a person's survivor choice. `survivor.merge` owns the changeset and redirect;
pointing owners union statements, retaining collisions as superseded.

The [declared folds](addon.toml) preserve proven source and person decisions;
unproven attribution blocks retirement by row. Migration docstrings own the
retained evidence, discarded legacy data and reversal contracts.
